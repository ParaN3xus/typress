Typst Mathematical Expression OCR based on [TrOCR](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/trocr).

## Install

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repo and enter it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ParaN3xus/typress
cd typress
```

Install dependencies:

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage project dependencies. If you don't have Poetry installed, please follow the instructions on the [Poetry installation page](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

```sh
poetry install
```

### TODO: PyPI

## Run

### Development Run or Internal Use

#### Run Typress Web server

Ensure you are in the repo root directory and execute

```sh
poetry shell
python -m typress
```

### Production Run or Shared Use

#### Set Up .env

Create a .env file in the repo root directory with the following content:

```sh
MODEL_PATH=path/to/your/model
API_ROOT_URL=https://api.example.com/typress
```

#### Run WSGI

To run the application in production mode, it is recommended to use a production-grade WSGI server such as `gunicorn`:

```sh
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:app
```

## TODO

- [ ] Improve the tex2typ reconstruction strategy for `spacing`.
- [ ] Fix memory leaks in normalized formulas
- [ ] Fix memory leaks in formula detection
- [x] Add formula detection
- [ ] Explore using LoRA to fine-tune the OCR model for TeX
- [ ] Publish to PyPI
- [ ] Document the complete dataset construction process
- [ ] ~~Train using `seq2seqtrainer`~~

## Contributing

### Data Contribution

If you have a collection of Typst mathematical formula text (which can be included in Typst documents), you can create a dataset by running the following command in the Typst workspace root:

```bash
python -m typress.dataset extract
```

Then, submit the generated `out.json` file to us via email at [paran3xus007@gmail.com](mailto:paran3xus007@gmail.com). By submitting your data to us, you agree to make your dataset publicly available.

### Code Contribution

We welcome any code contributions, including bug fixes, feature additions, etc. If you're unsure where to start, you can refer to our Todo list.
